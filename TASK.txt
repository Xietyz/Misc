## OLD
you are passed a list of IDs and an object containing a string 'event' (the state) and the corresponding ID.
write tests to figure out which state the ID is on and/or which events is has passed.
events are:
- non existent
- create
- in progress/actions
- completed
- error
use linq as much as possible
event's an ordered list
